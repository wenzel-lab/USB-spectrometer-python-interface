# Spectrometer workbench with modular optics cubes and an OceanOptics spectrometer

[OpenUC2 cube](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2-GIT) based spectrometer workbench that works 
with a [custom Python interface](https://github.com/wenzel-lab/UV-VIS-fiber-spectrometer-workbench/tree/main/OceanOptics-USB-spectrometer-python-interface) to operate Ocean Optics USB fiber spectrometers. The software is in an early stage of development (alpha) and improvement suggestions (pull requests) are most welcome.

All our custom OpenUC2 [cube CAD design files can be found online in OnShape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/6ad90b1b9211810137d71b1d/w/b1b0cc05a0494bf4bc912f91/e/b6d8f1f09207d829cc00d68a?renderMode=0&uiState=659ffe3141c1133546194703), and many of their STL files on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/514706-uc2-optics-cubes).

The specific models we tested and custom designed for this little project can also be found in the [subfolder of this repository](https://github.com/wenzel-lab/UV-VIS-fiber-spectrometer-workbench/tree/main/custom-UC2-cubes).
